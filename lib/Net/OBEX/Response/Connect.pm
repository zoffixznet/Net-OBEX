=head1 NAME

Net::OBEX::Response::Connect - interpret OBEX protocol Connect response packets

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Net::OBEX::Response;

    my $res = Net::OBEX::Response->new;

    # read 7 bytes of the Connect packet from the socket there somewhere
    # now parse it:
    my $response_ref = $res->parse( $data_from_the_socket, 1 );

    if ( $response_ref->{headers_length} ) {
        # ok, looks like we got some headers in this packet
        # read $response_ref->{headers_length} bytes from the socket
        # here and parse the headers.
    }

    # OMG SO COMPLICATED!!
    # Why not use Net::OBEX::Response parse_sock() method instead?!

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<WARNING!!! this module is still in early alpha stage. It is recommended
that you use it only for testing.>

This module is used internally by L<Net::OBEX::Response> and that's what
you probably should be using.
This module provides means to interpret raw OBEX protocol Connect responses.
For other responses see L<Net::OBEX::Response::Generic>

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new

    my $res = Net::OBEX::Response::Connect->new;

Takes no arguments, returns a freshly baked, Net::OBEX::Response::Connect
object ready to be used and abused.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 parse_info

    $res->packet( $data_from_wire );
    my $connect_response = $res->parse_info;

    # or

    my $connect_response = $res->parse_info( $data_from_wire );

Takes one optional argument which is the raw data from the wire
representing the Connect response packet. If called without
arguments will use the data which you set via C<packet()> method
(see documentation for L<Net::OBEX::Response::Generic>)
Returns a hashref with the following keys/values:

Sample returns (descriptions are below):

    $VAR1 = {
        'mtu' => 5126,
        'flags' => '00000000',
        'packet_length' => 31,
        'obex_version' => '00010000',
        'response_code' => 200,
        'headers_length' => 24,
        'response_code_meaning' => 'OK, Success'
    };

=head3 packet_length

    { 'packet_length' => 3 }

The C<packet_length> key will contain the length of the packet in bytes.

=head3 headers_length

    { 'headers_length' => 24 }

The C<headers_length> key will contain the length of packet's headers in
bytes. You would use this value to finish reading the entire packet from
the socket, however, see the C<parse_sock()> method described below.

=head3 response_code

    { 'response_code' => 200 }

The C<response_code> key will contain a response code, this will pretty
much be HTTP response codes since that what OBEX prefers to use.

=head3 response_code_meaning

    { 'response_code_meaning' => 'OK, Success' }

The C<response_code_meaning> key will contain a human parseable explanation
of C<response_code>.

=head3 mtu

    { 'mtu' => 5126 }

The C<mtu> key will contain the MTU of the responding device, i.e. the
maximum length of a packet (in bytes) the device can accept.

=head3 flags

    { 'flags' => '00000000' }

The C<flags> key will contain an unpacked "flags" byte, all but the first
of those 8 bits are reserved. If the first bit is set it
I<indicates support for multiple IrLMP connections to the same LSAP-SEL>

=head3 obex_version

    { 'obex_version' => '00010000' }

The C<obex_version> key will contain an unpacked "version" byte.
Which is the version of the OBEX protocol encoded with the major number
in the high order 4 bits, and the minor version in the low order 4 bits.

=head2 other methods

The module also provides C<code_meaning()>, C<headers_length()>,
C<packet> and
C<info()> methods which are described in documentation for
L<Net::OBEX::Response::Generic>.
